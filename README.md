# System for PRJ(Project) subject in my degree in 'Analysis and systems Development'.
The idea came when a friend told me that she'll open a Esthetic Shop, and that she needed something to control the business. Something to help with the management of clients, products, services and with the scheduling. This software would be a desktop system at the first moment, but I need to learn more about web languages, so that's what i'm doing. Now, the system works only for the owner, he can control eveything and he needs to take care of the schedules, homever, there's a login system with common and administrator user, so it can be easily implemented and go online in the future.
